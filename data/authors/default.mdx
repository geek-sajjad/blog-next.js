🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm Sajad Sohrabi, a backend-focused senior software engineer with deep experience in building scalable systems using **Node.js** and **Go**. Over the years, I’ve worked on complex systems including crypto trading platforms and event-driven microservices. I enjoy solving performance challenges, refactoring legacy code, and bringing clarity to distributed systems through clean architecture and solid documentation.

This site is my digital workspace — part resume, part blog — where I share insights from the backend trenches, personal projects, system design ideas, and thoughts on software engineering as a craft.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably learning something low-level about computers or exploring how technology can empower people.
